### Configuration
**a. Pre-installed Pico W**
  1. All pre-installed Picos come with firmware already baked into it.
  2. Connect the RNG SyNC module to your Rover using RJ12 cable. If you are using Wanderer/ Adventurer remove the **5V** jumper pin on PCB and power the device through USB.
  3. Configure with bluetooth using this webpage -> [RNG SyNC App](https://thewestlabs.github.io/RNG-SyNC-doc/). Read more about using the app on [Wiki](https://github.com/thewestlabs/RNG-SyNC-doc/wiki/BLE-App).

**b. Using your own Pico W**

If you opted for your own Pico, check manual configuration steps [wiki/Manual-configuration](https://github.com/thewestlabs/RNG-SyNC-doc/wiki/Manual-configuration)

### Connector cable

You will need an RJ12 cable to connect to your charge controller. You can buy one from Amazon ([link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BHVF6XS)) or your local store. Make sure it's **6P6C** marked as **"straight wired"**.
