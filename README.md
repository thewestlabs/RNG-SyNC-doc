# RNG SyNC
RNG SyNC is a Renogy¬π RS232 compatible  WiFi and Bluetooth adapter. Checkout the product [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/27955/). Tested with Rover/Wanderer/Adventurer series charge controllers.

### Configuration
**a. Pre-installed Pico W**
  1. All pre-installed Picos come with firmware already baked into it.
  2. Power up the device by connecting to USB or RJ12 cable and configure via BLE using this webpage -> [RNG SyNC Configurator](https://thewestlabs.github.io/RNG-SyNC-doc/). Read more about using the app on [Wiki/BLE App](https://github.com/thewestlabs/RNG-SyNC-doc/wiki/BLE-App).
  3. Your RNG SyNC module is now ready to deploy, just connect it to your Rover using RJ12 cable. If you are using low power models like Wanderer/ Adventurer, its reccomended to remove the **5V** jumper pin and power the device through USB.
